# align short (50bp) *single end* whole genome reads from mouse tumor
# mark illumina adapters, filter unmapped reads and multimapped reads, index and sort
# intended to run on gardner HPC with PBS wrapper
# before using, make executable with chmod
# before starting, update the readgroup information (not currently encoded as a variable)

# The following inputs are required:
# 1. Single read fastq file containing all the reads
# 2. Reference sequence for alignment -- indexed for bwa and with picard dictionary (see musprep script)
# 3. Known germline SNPs and Indels for BQSR
# NB: this script expects the reference genome, index files and known variants in working directory

# The following outputs are obtained:
# 1. ${SAMPLE}_bqsr.bam --> ready for variant calling
# 2. ${SAMPLE}_unaligned.bam --> bam file containing raw reads for archival purposes

# SETUP #
#########

# set script to fail if any command, variable, or output fails
set -euo pipefail

# set IFS to split only on newline and tab
IFS=$'\n\t' 

# load compilers

# NB: the path to picard.jar and gatk.jar is loaded with the module
# location of picard.jar = ${PICARD}
# location of gatk.jar = ${GATK}
