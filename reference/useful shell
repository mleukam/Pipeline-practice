## GARDNER TIPS:

For batch jobs 
## = comments

#PBS is directive to scheduler

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#PBS -N <job_name>

## define the shell

#PBS -S /bin/bash

## request resources, single node, single processer. Can request up to 28 processer (if the process is able to handle multiple processers) Requesting more processers means you have to wait longer. If your application cannot handle more than one processer, it will just block people from using the additional processers but not use them. Run a few test cases and get an estimate of time and then get an estimate of the time. Add at least 10% for extra time. You do want the time to be as accurrate as possible because shorter time requests can get squeezed in more easily. Request RAM memory. If you run out of memory it will kill the job. 

#PBS -l walltime=8:00:00
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1
#PBS -l mem=4gb

## specify the standard output file (rather than printing to screen)
#PBS -o /home/mleukam/output.log

## specify the standard error (rather than printing to screen)
#PBS -e /home/mleukam/error.log

## load compiler
module load gcc/6.2.0

## load programs
module load R/3.4.1

## executable section



## when you submit a job, it will give you a job number. Can check the status of the job with qstat (queue status)

qstat
watch qstat

## to show how much time is remaining
